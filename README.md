# 🐚 A toy LSH written in C

### Fun facts
* I have a literature board exam in a few hours.
* I actually staged and committed this repo using this shell.

The built in commands are cd, exit, and help. Use any other linux commands that you know as well, run man whatever to see man pages. Aight, I'm out.

### Usage
* Compile using g++ or gcc, yes this is too simple for a makefile.
* Run ./a.out
* Use like a normal shell
